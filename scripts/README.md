# Scripts

`compute.py` turns the tree in `data/` into headline numbers. Plain Python, standard library only, written 2026-09-08 (roadmap step 5) against the schema in docs/node-schema.md.

    python3 scripts/compute.py validate            check the tree against the schema (the default)
    python3 scripts/compute.py shape               print the tree's shape: counts, leaves, tiers
    python3 scripts/compute.py run [--runs N]      play the tree out once per longevity scenario
    python3 scripts/compute.py compare [--runs N]  the decision comparison, one choice group at a time

`validate` and `shape` work on a tree with no probabilities. `run` and `compare` refuse until every open world node has a probability for every scenario, which is Phase 3. The rules the script enforces are listed in docs/node-schema.md under "Rules the compute script enforces".

How a run works: for each scenario, the tree is played out many thousands of times. Nodes are visited in dependency order; a world node whose dependencies all came true comes true with its probability for that scenario, and otherwise stays false. Nodes already resolved in the real world are fixed. Choice points are set to their current-plan option. A tier is reached when everything it requires came true, and the number reported for a tier is the fraction of play-throughs that reached it. Contact Clause nodes are reported separately and never feed a tier.
